        <p> Unicode is a superset of ASCII that contains the same 
            first 128 bytes but adds many others to support multiple
            scripts and countries. Unicode allows emojis, many scripts
            most special characters. It has over a million supported
            characters. Because of the immense range of the characters
            each character typically require more space than ASCII often
            using multiple bytes per character.   </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> Unicode was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by
            the Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organization that
            includes representatives from major technology companies
            such as Apple, Microsoft, and IBM. The goal of Unicode was
            to create a universal character encoding standard that
            could be used by all computers and devices, regardless of
            their language or script. Unicode has since become the
            most widely used character encoding standard in the world,
            and is supported by virtually all modern software and
            operating systems.

        </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> Unicode has had a significant impact on the way that text is
            represented and processed in computers. It has made it
            possible for people around the world to communicate and
            share information in their own languages and scripts, and
            has facilitated the development of global applications and
            services. Unicode has also enabled the use of emojis, which
            have become an important part of modern communication.
            Overall, Unicode has played a crucial role in the evolution
            of digital communication and continues to be an essential
            technology for the modern world.
