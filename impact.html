        <h2>ASCII</h2>
        <p>ASCII's impact is significant as it laid the foundation for modern
            character encoding systems. It enabled computers to communicate 
            and share information effectively, leading to the development of 
            more advanced encoding standards like Unicode and UTF-8. ASCII's 
            simplicity and widespread adoption have made it a fundamental 
            technology in computing, influencing the way text is represented 
            and processed in digital systems.
        </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>Unicode</h2>
        <p>Unicode has transformed the digital world by providing a unified
            standard for representing text across all languages and scripts. 
            Unlike earlier encoding systems that were region-specific and 
            limited in scope, Unicode assigns a unique code point to every 
            character, symbol, and emoji, enabling consistent communication 
            across platforms, cultures, and devices. Its vast repertoire—now
            encompassing over 149,000 characters—supports everything from 
            ancient scripts to modern technical symbols, making it indispensable
            for global software development, web content, and data exchange. 
            Unicode’s universality has simplified localization, enhanced 
            accessibility, and ensured that digital systems can handle multilingual
             content with precision and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h2>UTF-8</h2>
        <p>UTF-8, the most widely used Unicode encoding, brought efficiency and 
            compatibility to the forefront of modern computing. As a variable-length
            encoding, UTF-8 uses one to four bytes per character, allowing it to 
            represent the full range of Unicode characters while remaining compact
            for common scripts like English. Crucially, it preserves backward
            compatibility with ASCII, making it ideal for integrating legacy
            systems and web technologies. UTF-8’s byte-order independence and minimal
             storage overhead have made it the default encoding for the internet, powering
             websites, APIs, and databases worldwide. Its seamless handling of
              multilingual text and robust error recovery mechanisms have cemented UTF-8
               as the backbone of inclusive, scalable digital communication.
