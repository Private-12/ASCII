        <p> ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
            is an encoding system that allows computers to store characters. 
            It uses a 7 bit number that cotains 128 characters. There is also 
            an extended 8 bit version that contains 256 characters. There are 
            33 non-printing characters that are used to control how text and
            space are processed. The remaining 95 characters are printable,
            they  include letters, numbers, punctuation marks and special
            characters.

        <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p> ASCII was developed in the early 1960s by the American
            National Standards Institute (ANSI) to provide a standard way
            for computers to represent text. Before ASCII, different
            computers used different encoding systems, which made it
            difficult for them to communicate with each other. ASCII was
            designed to be a universal standard that could be used by all
            computers. It was first published in 1963 and has since become
            the most widely used character encoding system in the world.
